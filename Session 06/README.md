# Business Intelligence and Data Warehouse Course

## Session 6

The topic of this session is **Data Modelling** (in particular, data warehouse modelling). This repository includes the content discussed in class.

## Main Concepts

  - Data Warehouse design and implementation

## FAQ

### Is it possible to consider automated testing in a data warehouse?

Yes. Read this interesting [article](https://medium.com/@josh.temple/automated-testing-in-the-modern-data-warehouse-d5a251a866af) about the topic. A potential tool to use is [dbt](https://www.getdbt.com). 

### What can I do if I don't have access to the data yet?

You can generate random data to start working. For example, you can use [Mockaroo](https://www.mockaroo.com/) or [GenerateData](http://generatedata.com).

Another option is to generate synthetic data. There are many differen approaches that can be categorized into three main groups: **synthetic reconstruction**, **combinatorial optimization**, and **model-based generation**.
