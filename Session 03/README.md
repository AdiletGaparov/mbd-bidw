## FAQ

### Which is the meaning of MySQL Workbench flags? 

When creating attributes with MSQL Workbench we can use different flags:

  - PK: Primary Key
  - NN: Not Null
  - BIN: Binary (stores data as binary strings. There is no character set so sorting and comparison is based on the numeric values of the bytes in the values.)
  - UN: Unsigned (non-negative numbers only. so if the range is -500 to 500, instead its 0 - 1000, the range is the same but it starts at 0)
  - UQ: Create/remove Unique Key
  - ZF: Zero-Filled (if the length is 5 like INT(5) then every field is filled with 0â€™s to the 5th value. 12 = 00012, 400 = 00400, etc. )
  - AI: Auto Increment
  - G: Generated column. i.e. value generated by a formula based on the other columns.
