## FAQ

### Do we have different environment in DW/BI?

Yes. We can have four environments:

 - **Production Environment (PROD)**: DW/BI system production-ready
 - **Developer Environment (Developer Sandbox)**: DW/BI system’s development environment
 - **Quality Assurance Environment (QA)**: all developers’ changes are integrated in this environment and the DW/BI system quality controls are performed
 - **Pre-production environment (PRE-PROD)**: is a production-like environment, tests and end-user demonstrations run on this environment
 
 A DW/BI must have at least, the first two.
